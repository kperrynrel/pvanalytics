-------------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Updated function :py:func:`~pvanalytics.system.infer_orientation_fit_pvwatts`
  to more closely align with the PVWatts v5 methodology. This includes incorporating
  relative airmass and extraterrestrial irradiance into the Perez total irradiance model,
  accounting for array incidence loss (IAM), and including losses in the PVWatts
  inverter model. Additionally, added optional arguments for bounding the azimuth range in
  during least squares optimization. (:issue:`147`, :pull:`180`)
